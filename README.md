# Destructive Wars

## Description

This mod aims to make wars more destructive to the environment.

This mod adds the following features:

- Arrows have a 10% chance to start a fire on the tile they land on
- When an actor is turned into a warrior, there is a 30% chance they get the same ability as a pyromaniac, that is they will throw torches that cause fire
- When an actor is turned into a warrior, there is a 10% chance they get the same ability as a bomberman, giving them small grenades to throw.
