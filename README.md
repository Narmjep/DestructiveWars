# Destructive Wars

v1.1

## Description

This mod aims to make wars more destructive to the environment.

This mod adds the following features:

- Arrows have a 10% chance to start a fire on the tile they land on
- Arrows have a 10% chance to explode on impact
- When an actor is turned into a warrior, there is a 20% chance they get the same ability as a bomberman, allowing them to throw bombs at tiles

Each feature can be tweaked in the `worldbox_Data/StreamingAssets/destructivewars_config.json` file.
